// 4.	abstract class Item with abstract toString method.
// Make Book, Magazine and Comics inherited from Item class.
// Mix Iterable behavior into Itemâ€™s prototype


// An object becomes an iterable if it implements a function whose key is Symbol.iterator and returns an iterator.
// The iterator itself is an object with a function called next inside it. next should return an object with two keys value and done. value contains the next element of the iteration and done a flag saying if the iteration has finished.
